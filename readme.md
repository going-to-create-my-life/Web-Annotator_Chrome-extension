## Features ✨ 👇

### 1. 🖍️ Text Highlighting
- This feature allows users to highlight text on any webpage by simply selecting the text and clicking a highlight button. This is especially useful for marking important sections, quotes, or any piece of information that stands out.

### 2. 🔄 Persistent Highlights
- Unlike temporary highlights that disappear after refreshing the page, this tool ensures that all your highlights remain intact. It uses local storage or cookies to remember your highlights, so they persist even after you close and reopen your browser.

### 3. 🎨 Multiple Colors
- Users can choose from a palette of colors to highlight their text. This is particularly useful for categorizing different types of information, such as using one color for definitions and another for key arguments. You can also change the color of your highlights later to re-categorize or reorganize your notes.

### 4. 🖥️ User-Friendly Interface
- The tool includes an intuitive toolbar that is easy to navigate. It has clear icons and labels, making it simple for users to highlight text, choose colors, add comments, and perform other actions without any hassle.

### 5. 💾 Save Highlights
- Users have the option to save their highlights directly to their device. This ensures that their work is backed up and can be accessed offline. This feature supports various save methods like downloading a file or saving to a specific folder on your computer.

### 6. 📋 Copy Highlights
- With a simple click, users can copy any highlighted text to their clipboard. This makes it easy to paste the information into other documents, emails, or notes, facilitating quick sharing and use of the highlighted content.

### 7. 💬 Comments
- This feature allows users to attach comments to their highlights. Users can provide additional context, ask questions, or make notes that are saved along with the highlighted text. These comments can be edited or deleted as needed.

### 8. 📂 Saving Format
- The tool supports saving highlights and comments in multiple formats. Users can choose to save their work as plain text files (.txt), rich text files (.html), or formatted documents (.pdf), depending on their needs and preferences.

### 9. ⌨️ Navigation on Highlights
- Using keyboard shortcuts, users can quickly jump from one highlight to the next. This is especially useful for reviewing notes, studying for exams, or when working through lengthy documents.

### 10. 🔍 Search and Sort
- The tool includes a powerful search feature that allows users to find specific text within their highlights and comments. Additionally, users can sort their highlights by various criteria, such as date added, color, or comment content, making it easier to organize and review their notes.

These features collectively make the highlighting tool a comprehensive and indispensable aid for students, researchers, and professionals who regularly work with digital text.
